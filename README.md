This repository is made for the <b> Theory of Algorithms </b> module assessment. It contains two Jupyter Notebooks with the following:
    <br>
1. <b> post-correspondence.ipynb </b>
    * Definition and explanation of the Post Correspondence Problem.
    * Definition and explanation of the Bounded Post Correspondence Problem.
    * Python function to solve the Bounded Post Correspondence Problem.
    * Explanation of what an undecidable problem is in computability theory, with reference to the Post Correspondence Problem.
    <br>
2. <b> countdown.ipynb </b>
    * Overview and explanation of the Countdown Numbers Game.
    * Discussion of the complexity of the Countdown Numbers Game.
    * Python function to solve the Countdown Numbers Game.
    * An explanation of the functional aspect of the code.
